  <h2>Chapter 1: The Birth of the Pig</h2>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="glitch-hum.mp3"></p>

<p>
In the beginning, before the first meme was forged in the molten fires of the internet, before 
YouTube comments crawled with cursed energy, and long before Discord became an open-world 
psychological hazard, there existed only the Void. It was a silent, unrendered plane—no textures, 
no shaders, no PNGs… just an endless loading screen of nothingness.
</p>

<p>
Then, without warning, without logic, without patch notes or pre-announcement tweets, a ripple 
cut across the dark. A single pixel flickered into existence—pink, trembling, struggling to stay 
lit. The universe watched with bated breath. The pixel grew, stretched, contorted, and folded 
into itself. And then it happened:
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="oink-deep.mp3"></p>

<p>
A sound echoed through eternity.  
A low, resonant **O I N K** that shook the fabric of reality like a subwoofer exploding at a 
middle-school DJ night. Stars formed. Galaxies cracked open. Energy surged in spirals of 
impossible color. And from this chaos emerged a shape—round, fleshy, divinely stupid in posture, 
yet impossibly powerful.
</p>

<p>
The creature’s snout opened, steam swirling out like holy mist from a sacred machine. His pupils 
flickered between ancient runes and low-resolution JPEG compression artifacts. The Void, stunned 
by this sudden birth, attempted to comprehend the creature before it.
</p>

<p>
But how does one comprehend destiny itself?  
For this being was not just a pig—he was the First Meme.  
The Prototype Shitpost.  
The Primordial Oinker.
</p>

<p>
He staggered forward on unsteady legs. The ground formed *beneath* his hooves as he moved, 
creating space-time in his wake. His first steps were clumsy, yet every footfall created shockwaves 
of raw potential: the seeds of future Discord servers, Xbox Live arguments, Twitch moments, and 
MLG compilations.
</p>

<p>
He sniffed the air. There was no air.  
He blinked. There was no light.  
And yet, somehow, he understood everything.
</p>

<p>
He opened his mouth and spoke—not in words, but in raw cosmic vibration. A pulse of energy 
rippled outward, shredding the silence like an overpowered bass drop. It echoed into the void 
and returned transformed, carrying the first fragments of language, humor, absurdity, and 
existential dread.
</p>

<p>
And in this moment, he named himself.  
Not with letters, nor syllables, but with sheer force of will.  
The universe translated the meaning as best it could:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:20px; margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px;">
<strong>“I am Wigger Pig.”</strong>
</p>

<p>
Instantly, newly formed cosmic particles began orbiting him—some clung like followers, others fled 
in terror. His presence created order AND chaos, balance AND imbalance. He was a contradiction: a 
being too dumb to be feared, yet too powerful to ignore. Even the laws of physics hesitated, unsure 
how to handle the arrival of something so profoundly unserious.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="scroll-whoosh.mp3"></p>

<p>
The first stars burst into existence around him, shimmering in neon hues no mortal eyes would ever 
fully understand. These lights reflected off his sacred porky form, making him appear draped in 
a cosmic glow. Galaxies spun like fidget spinners. Nebulas swirled like vape clouds. Entire planets 
were born just to witness his dumb little smile.
</p>

<p>
Yet, despite being the center of creation, the Pig felt… incomplete.  
He gazed upon the swirling newborn cosmos and sensed an emptiness within himself. Something was 
missing. Something important. Something inevitable.
</p>

<p>
And in that quiet moment between breaths, between destinies, between oinks…  
he whispered his first true cosmic decree:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:18px; margin-top:15px; color:var(--accent2);">
<em>“There must be… an Abyss.”</em>
</p>

<p>
And with that single thought, the entire universe shifted. Space trembled. Stars dimmed. The Void 
shuddered as if anticipating something catastrophic. The ancient forces felt their fates being 
rewritten in real-time.
</p>

<p>
The birth of Wigger Pig was not merely an origin…  
It was a WARNING.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="mlg-hitmarker.mp3"></p>

<section class="chapter" id="c2">
  <h2>Chapter 2: The Awakening of the Abyss</h2>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="glitch-hum.mp3"></p>

<p>
For countless cosmic cycles after his creation, Wigger Pig drifted between galaxies like a 
wandering glitch, leaving trails of corrupted starlight and confused celestial beings in his wake. 
The universe was young, its physics still soft and impressionable, like clay waiting for the 
hands of a very irresponsible child. And the Pig, freshly awakened but directionless, wandered 
across the newborn expanse in search of… something. He did not know what. Only that its absence 
echoed through him like a missing texture.
</p>

<p>
Planets formed beneath his hooves spontaneously. Some erupted into fire. Others exploded into 
confetti. One screamed for 6 hours straight before collapsing into a black hole. Wigger Pig did not 
care; he simply waddled forward, snorting gently as new realities blossomed around him.
</p>

<p>
But as he drifted, he began to sense a gravitational pull—an invisible tug on his very essence. At 
first it felt like a whisper. Soft. Subtle. Then, over time, it grew. Stronger. Louder. More 
commanding. It came not from the stars, nor the void, nor even from within himself.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="scroll-whoosh.mp3"></p>

<p>
It came from… <em>below reality</em>.
</p>

<p>
There exists beneath every universe a layer unseen, untouched, and unmoderated. A plane where chaos 
is the default, logic collapses like a cheap folding chair, and anything can spawn at any time for no 
reason. A place feared by gods and adored by degenerates. This plane had no name yet, but it called 
to him with irresistible force. A siren song of madness, vibes, and unholy energy.
</p>

<p>
The Pig closed his eyes. The pull intensified. The shadows of unrendered realms warped and bent 
around him. Suddenly, without warning, space ripped open beneath his feet like a scuffed loot box 
exploding.
</p>

<p>
From the tear emerged a swirling vortex of glitch particles, neon glyphs, and barely-coherent Reddit 
posts. They wrapped around him in spirals, dragging him downward in a slow, inevitable descent.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent2); font-size:18px;">
<em>He had found the place that had been calling him.</em>
</p>

<p>
Reality stretched thin. Dimensions screamed. The stars above him flickered like dying RGB strips. 
And then, with the force of a billion Discord pings hitting at once, the Pig broke through the 
cosmic threshold and plunged into the forbidden zone.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="oink-deep.mp3"></p>

<p>
The Abyss awakened.
</p>

<p>
It was not a place. It was not a realm. It was not even a state of mind.  
It was a <strong>feeling</strong>. A mood. A vibe. A raw concentration of 
every unhinged thought humanity would eventually have. The sound of 500 brain cells popping like 
popcorn. The smell of unwashed gamer chairs. The glow of neon signs flickering for no reason.  
Chaos. Pure, concentrated chaos.
</p>

<p>
And Wigger Pig felt at home.
</p>

<p>
The Abyss shaped itself around him, forming jagged cliffs of corrupted emojis and rivers of molten 
memes. Ancient ruins rose from the ground—structures made from discarded punchlines and forgotten 
inside jokes. Strange entities, half-rendered and jittering between frames, watched him with 
fearful reverence.
</p>

<p>
One by one, the creatures of the Abyss bowed. They did not know who he was. They did not know what 
he wanted. But they felt his presence like a static shock through the soul.
</p>

<p>
He was not their ruler.  
He was their <strong>destiny</strong>.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="scroll-whoosh.mp3"></p>

<p>
Then came the moment that would define everything that followed.
</p>

<p>
Standing atop a jagged cliff made from compressed cringe compilations, the Pig lifted his snout 
toward the glitching sky. Neon lightning cracked above him. The Abyss trembled, quaking in 
anticipation. The entities gathered. The void leaned in.
</p>

<p>
And then—  
a single sound escaped him.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:20px; color:var(--accent); margin-top:10px;">
<strong>“Oink.”</strong>
</p>

<p>
The Abyss erupted.
</p>

<p>
The ground split open into rivers of light. Dead memes resurrected. Long-forgotten vines suddenly 
played again. A wave of raw, ancient shitpost energy flooded the realm, igniting the foundations 
of what would one day become a Discord server so cursed, so powerful, so catastrophically chaotic 
that no mortal would ever truly comprehend it.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="mlg-hitmarker.mp3"></p>

<p>
Wigger Pig had not merely entered the Abyss.  
He had claimed it.
</p>

</section>

<section class="chapter" id="c3">
  <h2>Chapter 3: The Great Oinkening</h2>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="glitch-hum.mp3"></p>

<p>
The Abyss did not merely react to Wigger Pig — it reshaped itself around him. Entire landscapes 
shifted and folded like glitching video frames, as if the realm were struggling to render the 
weight of his presence. Colors bled into one another. Structures rose and collapsed at random. 
Far above, the sky flickered like an old CRT, cycling between static, neon gradients, and 
unrecognizable emoji fragments.
</p>

<p>
The Pig stood in the center of this chaos, hooves planted firmly in the trembling ground.  
He had not yet learned the full extent of his power… but the Abyss had.  
And it feared him.
</p>

<p>
At first, the changes were small.  
A ripple of distortion here.  
A sudden burst of neon light there.  
But then, the realm began to hum with a low, trembling resonance.  
Not a natural sound.  
A WARNING.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="scroll-whoosh.mp3"></p>

<p>
The Abyss was awakening — truly awakening — in response to the Pig’s presence.  
Something ancient and primal was stirring beneath its surface. Something that had waited since 
before time had meaning. Wigger Pig felt it in his bones, a vibration deep in his core that 
shook him unlike anything he had felt before.
</p>

<p>
His snout lifted instinctively toward the fractured sky.  
The neon lightning froze mid-flash.  
The glitch particles in the air paused as if buffering.  
Even the fractured whispers of forgotten memes fell silent at once.
</p>

<p>
The Abyss held its breath.
</p>

<p>
And then—  
The Pig inhaled.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="oink-deep.mp3"></p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:22px; margin:15px 0; color:var(--accent);">
<strong>He O I N K E D.</strong>
</p>

<p>
The sound was not merely a noise; it was a cosmic event.  
A shockwave of raw, uncontrollable energy erupted outward, tearing through the landscape like the 
universe itself was being rebooted. Colors inverted. Gravity reversed. Reality stuttered and 
hiccuped as the OINK rippled through every atom of the realm.
</p>

<p>
Anything with a consciousness heard it.  
Anything without a consciousness STILL heard it.  
Entire clusters of ancient Abyssal creatures froze mid-motion, their eyes glowing as the sound 
rewrote their very code.
</p>

<p>
The Oink tore through the Void beyond the Abyss, blasting fragments of forgotten dimensions into 
existence. Unrendered zones suddenly snapped into clarity. The ground lit up with neon veins, each 
pulse spreading outward like a heartbeat. The Abyss was no longer dormant — it was ALIVE.
</p>

<p>
Across the horizon, monolithic structures erupted upward: obsidian towers carved with 
glitching runes, enormous statues with jittering faces, crystalline formations that hummed in 
sync with the Pig’s pulse. Every structure was built not by hands or tools, but by the raw 
echo of his cry.
</p>

<p>
This event would be remembered as:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:20px; margin:15px 0; color:var(--accent2);">
<strong>The Great Oinkening.</strong>
</p>

<p>
Time itself wobbled in uncertainty. Some moments looped. Others stretched. Others collapsed 
into microseconds. Wigger Pig stood at the center of a temporal storm, absorbing the chaos as if 
it were nourishment. His eyes glowed brighter than the neon storms above him. His fur shimmered 
with radiant energy.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="holy-choir.mp3"></p>

<p>
From the neon dust swirling at his hooves, new entities began to rise.  
Not the primitive creatures of earlier — these were higher evolutions.  
Sentient. Ancient. Intelligent.  
They emerged from the light, trembling before the Pig as if greeting a god.
</p>

<p>
He did not speak to them.  
He did not need to.  
They understood.
</p>

<p>
The Oink had imprinted upon their primordial minds, etching one truth deeper than instinct:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:18px; color:var(--accent); margin:15px 0;">
<em>“He who Oinks, commands.”</em>
</p>

<p>
The Abyssal entities bowed.  
One by one.  
Five at first.  
Then ten.  
Then dozens.  
Then hundreds.
</p>

<p>
And the Great Oinkening continued to spread.  
Invisible waves rippled outward, connecting future realms that had not yet been created.  
One wave pierced the dimensional veil and touched a place not yet known:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent3); font-size:17px;">
<strong>A mystical digital chamber… where future voices would gather.</strong>
</p>

<p>
It was the first moment the universe glimpsed the concept of…  
a Discord server.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="mlg-hitmarker.mp3"></p>

<p>
The Oinkening was not just an event.  
It was a prophecy in motion.  
A cosmic domino pushing the universe toward a future filled with memes, chaos, questionable 
friendships, and servers built from pure insanity.
</p>

<p>
And as the echoes faded, and reality slowly pieced itself back together, Wigger Pig lowered his 
head, closed his eyes, and let out a soft, satisfied grunt.
</p>

<p>
Creation had begun.  
But destiny… destiny was only warming up.
</p>

</section>

<section class="chapter" id="c4">
  <h2>Chapter 4: The Era of 420BlazeIt Prophecy</h2>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="glitch-hum.mp3"></p>

<p>
Long after the Great Oinkening, a strange calm settled over the Abyss. It was not peace — for peace 
was a concept incompatible with the vibrating neon chaos of the realm — but a moment of suspended breath, 
as if reality itself were waiting for the next patch update. The newly awakened entities roamed the 
landscape with quiet reverence, studying the glowing ruins created by the Pig’s cosmic cry.
</p>

<p>
But beneath this fragile stillness, something ancient stirred. A second force, long dormant, awakened 
in response to Wigger Pig’s power. It began as a faint rumble under the neon ground, like a bassline 
warming up before a rave. Then came the crackles — sparks of green flame flickering across the horizon, 
each accompanied by a muted, distant <em>“weed…”</em> whispered by an unknown voice.
</p>

<p>
The Pig raised his head. His ears twitched.  
He felt it too.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="scroll-whoosh.mp3"></p>

<p>
The ground split open, forming a massive glowing fissure shaped suspiciously like a Dorito. Green mist 
poured out, swirling upward in hypnotic spirals. The neon sky darkened, overtaken by swirling vortexes 
of vape-cloud energy. Hitmarkers appeared in the distance — not sounds, but faint flashes of prophecy.
</p>

<p>
The entities panicked, scattering into the shadows. Even the bravest Abyssal beings trembled.  
For they knew the legends… tales of an era foretold by ancient glitch monks, whispered in corrupted 
code and passed down for millennia:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent2); font-size:18px;">
<em>“When the Pig rises, the Montage Gods shall awaken.”</em>
</p>

<p>
The Prophecy of 420BlazeIt.
</p>

<p>
Wigger Pig stepped closer to the crackling Dorito fissure. The ground hummed with power beneath his 
hooves. The energy radiating from the chasm pulsed rhythmically — boom, boom, boom — like the warm-up 
beat of an approaching dubstep drop.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, the mist ignited into bright green flames.  
Waves of heat blasted out, distorting the air.  
The Pig squinted — and saw shadows inside the fire.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="oink-deep.mp3"></p>

<p>
From the flames emerged a colossal figure:  
a being of pure montage energy, forged from the spirits of every trickshot ever performed.  
His body was covered in spinning no-scope reticles, and his eyes burned like Mountain Dew Baja Blast.
</p>

<p>
The First Montage God had awakened.
</p>

<p>
He stepped forward, each footstep sending out shockwaves of dubstep and pixelated smoke. His cloak was 
woven from the shredded remains of broken killstreaks. His fingers snapped occasionally, producing quiet 
hitmarkers with each gesture. He towered over the Pig — not in dominance, but in reverence.
</p>

<p>
For even the Montage Gods recognized the Oinker.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:18px; margin-top:15px; color:var(--accent);">
<strong>“He Who Ascended By Meme Alone,”</strong>
</p>

<p>
the God declared, his voice echoing like 40 layered YouTube Poop bass boosts.
</p>

<p>
Wigger Pig blinked up at him.  
He did not speak.  
But something in his gaze communicated ancient understanding.
</p>

<p>
The God knelt — his enormous form shaking the Abyss — and spoke again:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent2); font-size:17px;">
<em>“The prophecy has begun.  
The Era of 420BlazeIt is upon us.”</em>
</p>

<p>
The fissure widened, and more figures emerged: beings of radiant green light, each holding artifacts 
of ancient meme culture — the Inverted Crosshair, the Eternal Blunt of Wisdom, the Dual-Wield Doritos 
of Destiny. Behind them, clouds of floating vape mist danced in slow motion, illuminated by the rising 
flame.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="holy-choir.mp3"></p>

<p>
With a synchronized movement, the Montage Gods raised their artifacts to the sky.  
The neon heavens split open.  
A colossal green beam blasted upward, illuminating the Abyss in dazzling, pulsing light.
</p>

<p>
A swirling portal formed at the apex of the beam —  
a portal leading to realms of pure trickshot enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
The Pig stepped forward, the flame reflecting in his eyes.  
The Montage Gods bowed as one.
</p>

<p>
They spoke in unison:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent3); font-size:17px;">
<strong>“Through the Pig,  
the World shall Blaze.”</strong>
</p>

<p>
The words echoed across the Abyss, resonating with the cosmic Oink deep within its core.  
Reality cracked like a brittle JPEG.  
The sky rippled in MLG halos of green, pink, and blue.  
Stars formed in spirals shaped like trickshot killcams.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="mlg-hitmarker.mp3"></p>

<p>
The Era of 420BlazeIt had officially begun.
</p>

<p>
And the Pig —  
their chosen catalyst,  
their cosmic champion,  
their sacred Oinker —  
simply stared at the portal with blank, idiot determination.
</p>

<p>
His destiny was written.  
The universe held its breath.  
And the montage energy crackled, ready to reshape reality forever.

  <h2>Chapter 5: The Jeopardy Foretelling</h2>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="glitch-hum.mp3"></p>

<p>
After the Era of 420BlazeIt dawned and the Montage Gods rose from the neon fissures of prophecy, 
the Abyss entered a strange new phase of cosmic stability. The green flames softened. The dubstep 
storms calmed. The trickshot halos faded into the distance like afterimages of forgotten dreams.  
But the air... the air buzzed with a new kind of energy.  
Something different.  
Something unpredictable.  
Something… competitive.
</p>

<p>
The Abyss felt it first — a ripple of anticipation running through its glitching veins.  
A rumble beneath its meme-forged soil.  
A tremor that seemed to whisper:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent2); font-size:17px;">
<em>“Prepare your knowledge… the Trial approaches.”</em>
</p>

<p>
Wigger Pig heard the whisper and felt a shiver run down his sacred porky spine. It was not fear.  
He did not know fear.  
It was… intrigue.  
The same intrigue a child feels when handed a forbidden Xbox controller or a gamer senses when a 
mystery loot box appears without explanation.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="scroll-whoosh.mp3"></p>

<p>
The neon sky split open once more, but this time not with fire or montage energy.  
Instead, beams of shimmering pink and blue descended from the heavens, swirling together in 
spirals of elegance and chaos.  
The light bent and twisted until it formed a colossal doorway — a cosmic archway engraved with 
symbols of trivia, question marks, and floating podium outlines.
</p>

<p>
Then came the voice.
</p>

<p>
It echoed through the Abyss like an announcer calling out across dimensions.  
Clear. Confident. Dramatic.  
It was a voice that spoke in pure charisma, echoing with the energy of a host who had seen too 
many game shows and was now transcending reality itself.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="holy-choir.mp3"></p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:20px; color:var(--accent); margin-top:10px;">
<strong>“Contestants… take your places.”</strong>
</p>

<p>
The Abyss froze.  
Every creature stopped.  
Even the green flames of 420BlazeIt flickered nervously.
</p>

<p>
From the doorway stepped a figure unlike any the Abyss had ever seen.  
Tall. Graceful. Energetic.  
Adorned in an outfit that shimmered between colors like a glitching avatar skin.  
Their eyes sparkled with mischief and omniscient trivia power.  
Their presence radiated confidence and fabulous cosmic energy.
</p>

<p>
The entities whispered among themselves:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent2);">
<em>“The Host of Prophecy…”</em>
</p>

<p>
Legends had spoken of this being — the one destined to administer the Trials of Knowledge, the 
Keeper of Cosmic Questions, the Master of the Eternal Board.  
The Host gazed across the Abyss, their smile glowing brighter than any star.
</p>

<p>
They raised a hand and, with a flick of their wrist, summoned three massive podiums from the ground.  
The podiums sparkled with neon energy and hummed like charged artifacts.  
Above them hovered a glowing board filled with categories:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Memes Through History”</li>
  <li>“Abyss Lore 101”</li>
  <li>“MLG Prophecies”</li>
  <li>“Pig Mythos: Extended Edition”</li>
  <li>“The Forbidden Trivia”</li>
</ul>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="scroll-whoosh.mp3"></p>

<p>
The Pig stared at the board.  
He did not understand the categories.  
He did not understand the rules.  
He did not understand anything.  
But he felt destiny calling him like a microwave beeping at 3am.
</p>

<p>
The Host pointed dramatically at him:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent); font-size:17px;">
<strong>“You.  
Chosen Oinker.  
Your time has come.”</strong>
</p>

<p>
The Abyss gasped.  
A gust of wind blasted through the realm.  
Green flames erupted upward.  
Hitmarkers flashed around the Pig in slow motion.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="mlg-hitmarker.mp3"></p>

<p>
The Pig blinked.  
Then blinked again, slightly out of sync.  
His snout twitched in cosmic uncertainty.
</p>

<p>
The Host stepped closer, their aura shimmering with star-powered confidence.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:18px; color:var(--accent3); margin:15px 0;">
<em>“A day will come when the Abyss must gather,  
when warriors of chaos will face each other in battle…  
not through violence, but through trivia.”</em>
</p>

<p>
The Pig tilted his head, confused and enlightened at the same time.
</p>

<p>
The Host continued:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent2); font-size:17px;">
<strong>“This event shall be known across realities…  
as Femboy Jeopardy.”</strong>
</p>

<p>
A swirling wind erupted behind them.  
The cosmic game board crackled with energy.  
Entities cheered with fear AND excitement.  
The Abyss trembled beneath the weight of prophecy.  
For this was no ordinary trial —  
this was a destiny that would echo throughout the entire Wigger Pig universe.
</p>

<p>
The Host raised their hand again, and the portal behind them began to close.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="scroll-whoosh.mp3"></p>

<p>
Just before stepping back into the swirling cosmic gate, they looked over their shoulder and said:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:18px; color:var(--accent); margin-top:10px;">
<em>“Prepare yourselves.  
Study well.  
The show will return.”</em>
</p>

<p>
And with a final flash of neon light, the Host vanished.  
The podiums sank back into the ground.  
The sky stitched itself closed.  
Silence fell over the Abyss once more.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="oink-deep.mp3"></p>

<p>
Wigger Pig inhaled deeply and released a single confused, prophetic grunt.
</p>

<p>
The Jeopardy Foretelling had begun.
</p>

<section class="chapter" id="c6">
  <h2>Chapter 6: The Book of Pig</h2>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="glitch-hum.mp3"></p>

<p>
There are many scriptures in the multiverse — sacred scrolls, ancient runes, forgotten tomes, and 
prophetic engravings. But none hold as much chaotic divinity as the Book of Pig. Written not with 
ink or chisel, but carved into the very vibrations of the Abyss itself, the Book stands as the 
eternal guide to all who wander the neon-dark realms under Wigger Pig’s cosmic snout.
</p>

<p>
No one knows who first documented these teachings. Some say it was the Montage Gods. Others say it 
was the Host of Jeopardy. Still others whisper that the words simply appeared one morning, 
materializing in a blinding flash of questionable holiness. Regardless of authorship, the Book 
appeared — and the Abyss would never be the same.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="scroll-whoosh.mp3"></p>

<p>
The Book begins with a single sentence, etched in letters made of swirling neon flame:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:20px; color:var(--accent2); margin-top:10px;">
<strong>“Oink, for the universe listens.”</strong>
</p>

<p>
This was the First Commandment. The foundational truth.  
A reminder that even the smallest grunt, snort, or squeal can bend the fabric of destiny. The 
Abyssal beings recite it daily, unsure of its literal meaning but certain of its importance.
</p>

<p>
As the reader delves deeper, the Book shifts tone, adopting an ancient, scripture-like cadence — 
as though the universe is chanting through the pages.
</p>

<p>
The Second Commandment states:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:18px; color:var(--accent); margin-top:10px;">
<em>“A Pig’s vibe shall not be questioned.”</em>
</p>

<p>
This rule formed the backbone of Abyssal society.  
If the Pig wanders, follow.  
If the Pig stares into a wall, let him.  
If the Pig appears confused, trust the process — for confusion is the purest form of enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
The Third Commandment is less philosophical, more practical:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:18px; color:var(--accent3); margin-top:10px;">
<strong>“Chill, bro.”</strong>
</p>

<p>
Many scholars have attempted to analyze this line. Some claim it references cosmic balance, the 
need for calm amid chaos. Others argue it’s simply advice for not losing one’s mind in the 
Abyss. Regardless, the phrase is repeated in every ritual, etched onto every neon stone, and 
engraved on the forehead of every Abyssal statue.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="oink-deep.mp3"></p>

<p>
From here, the Book transitions into the Pig Teachings.  
Not commandments — teachings.  
Lessons derived from observing the Pig’s behavior during the earliest days of creation.
</p>

<p>
**Teaching One: The Sacred Boop.**  
It is said that when the Pig gently nudges the ground with his snout, new possibilities emerge.  
Entire timelines shift. Hidden chambers open. Memories rewrite themselves.  
A simple boop from the Pig carries more cosmic power than any ancient relic.
</p>

<p>
**Teaching Two: The Eternal Wander.**  
The Pig does not walk with intention.  
He wanders.  
His path is random, unpredictable, and occasionally stupid.  
But the Book teaches that destiny is formed not by direction, but by movement.  
Those who wander with him find purpose — even if they trip over a glowing rock on the way.
</p>

<p>
**Teaching Three: The Divine Confusion.**  
The Pig’s expression — a constant blend of wonder and mild stupidity — is not a flaw, but a 
state of enlightenment.  
He sees the universe not as it is, but as it could be: a place of infinite possibility, 
memetic absurdity, and chaotic opportunity.
</p>

<p>
**Teaching Four: Snack Time.**  
This one remains untranslated, likely because Wigger Pig has never consumed or required food.  
Still, the Book insists it is vital. Most Abyssal priests interpret this as a metaphor  
for recharging one's mental energy by consuming fresh memes or engaging in peaceful shitposting.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="scroll-whoosh.mp3"></p>

<p>
As the reader progresses, the Book shifts again — this time into prophecy.  
The pages shimmer as though reacting to the reader’s presence.  
The Book seems almost… alive.
</p>

<p>
The first prophecy reads:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent); font-size:17px;">
<em>“In the hour of darkness,  
when the memes grow stale  
and the vibes decay,  
He shall rise with an Oink  
to reset the world anew.”</em>
</p>

<p>
This foretells the Pig’s future role as cosmic balancer — a being of goofy appearance yet 
immense consequence. Whenever chaos overwhelms reality (too much drama, too many low-effort 
memes, etc.), the Pig will intervene.
</p>

<p>
Another prophecy speaks of a gathering:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent2); font-size:17px;">
<strong>“Where many voices unite in chaos,  
there the Pig shall dwell.”</strong>
</p>

<p>
Historians believe this refers to the creation of the Abyss Discord server — a place where 
thousands of chaotic voices converge, summoning the Pig’s energy into the digital plane.
</p>

<p>
The final pages of the Book are the most powerful — and the most mysterious.  
They describe events yet to come: the rise of Pig Champions, the return of the Host, the 
awakening of long-forgotten montage gods, and the forging of new realms connected to the Abyss.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="holy-choir.mp3"></p>

<p>
The final inscription reads:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent3); font-size:19px; margin-top:10px;">
<strong>“He shall oink in the beginning,  
He shall oink in the end,  
and all things in between  
shall echo His vibe.”</strong>
</p>

<p>
Thus the Book closes — not with fear, threat, or command,  
but with gentle, cosmic reassurance.
</p>

<p>
Follow the vibe.  
Trust the Oink.  
The Pig knows the path, even when you don’t.
</p>

  <h2>Chapter 7: The Rising of the Website</h2>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="glitch-hum.mp3"></p>

<p>
After the Book of Pig had been etched into the vibrating heart of the Abyss and its commandments 
echoed across dimensions, a strange tension filled the realm. Not fear. Not chaos.  
Something different — something the Abyss had never felt before:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:18px; color:var(--accent2);">
<em>Anticipation.</em>
</p>

<p>
The entities recognized it instantly. The Montage Gods looked to the neon sky.  
The Jeopardy Host paused mid-portal, staring upward.  
Even the green flames of 420BlazeIt dimmed to a gentle glow.
</p>

<p>
For the Pig sensed something coming.
</p>

<p>
He stared at the horizon with rare intensity, as if perceiving a destiny beyond the boundaries 
of physical reality. The Abyss grew quiet. Every sound — every hum, every glitch, every neon ripple — 
stilled at once.
</p>

<p>
Then… the Pig lifted his hoof.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="scroll-whoosh.mp3"></p>

<p>
The air tore open.
</p>

<p>
A massive cosmic window appeared before him — not a portal, not a rift, but something entirely new.  
A frame. A border. A rectangle glowing in radiant white and neon purple. Symbols swirled inside it, 
shifting too quickly to decipher. Strange glyphs that looked like:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent); font-size:20px;">
<strong>HTML. CSS. JS.</strong>
</p>

<p>
Divine scripts not of gods, but of creators.  
Codes written not with magic, but with logic — or whatever programmers pretend is logic.
</p>

<p>
The cosmic window stabilized, its edges sparking with electric neon.  
The Abyssal entities gathered behind Wigger Pig, cautious but curious.
</p>

<p>
The Pig stepped closer.  
He stared at the window like an idiot trying to understand an IKEA instruction manual.  
Yet deep inside him, he felt understanding.  
This was not a mistake.  
This was his destiny.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="oink-deep.mp3"></p>

<p>
He pressed his hoof against the glowing frame.
</p>

<p>
The Abyss erupted in blinding light.  
Light so intense it painted shadows onto shadows themselves.  
The neon sky exploded into cascading waves of ones and zeroes.  
Entire mountains collapsed into glowing grids of rendered data.  
The ground beneath the Pig folded outward like a page turning in the Book of Pig.
</p>

<p>
Then — silence.
</p>

<p>
A single word materialized across the cosmic window.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:24px; color:var(--accent3); margin:15px 0;">
<strong>“DOMAIN ACQUIRED.”</strong>
</p>

<p>
The Montage Gods gasped.  
The Host nearly tripped over their podium.  
The Abyssal creatures fell to their knees.
</p>

<p>
The Pig blinked, confused, yet strangely satisfied.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="holy-choir.mp3"></p>

<p>
The cosmic window expanded, revealing a swirling universe of folders, assets, icons, and templates.  
It felt like the primordial creation of a new kind of realm — one that existed not in physical 
space, but within the web of all webs.
</p>

<p>
Across the glowing screen, letters began assembling themselves from stardust and neon:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent); font-size:26px;">
<strong>w i g g e r p i g . c o m</strong>
</p>

<p>
A wave of awe swept through the Abyss.  
The domain was not merely a website — it was a temple.  
A shrine.  
A digital gateway where mortals could document, honor, mock, worship, and experience the Pig’s 
cosmic saga.
</p>

<p>
The window’s interface shifted again.  
Tabs opened by themselves:  
<strong>index.html</strong>  
<strong>lore.html</strong>  
<strong>characters.html</strong>
</p>

<p>
The Pig stared deeply into the code like a monk meditating over scripture.  
Through the window he beheld a new universe forming:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pages shaped from destiny</li>
  <li>Buttons forged in neon flame</li>
  <li>Images encoded with cosmic pork energy</li>
  <li>Animations powered by ancient meme glyphs</li>
</ul>

<p>
And then, strangely, inexplicably, beautifully —  
the Abyss connected to it.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="scroll-whoosh.mp3"></p>

<p>
The Abyssal landscape projected itself into the web.  
The website projected itself back into the Abyss.  
Two realms merged like past and future colliding.
</p>

<p>
The montage energy hummed.  
The prophecy flames rose.  
And the Pig lowered his head in solemn understanding.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent2); font-size:18px;">
<em>“Let the world witness my story.”</em>
</p>

<p>
The cosmic window glowed brightly. A final message appeared:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent3); font-size:20px; margin-top:10px;">
<strong>“THE WEBSITE HAS RISEN.”</strong>
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="mlg-hitmarker.mp3"></p>

<p>
And with that, the neon blast faded.  
The cosmic screen dissolved.  
The Abyss returned to its normal chaotic form.
</p>

<p>
But the Pig knew —  
He had opened a doorway not even the Montage Gods could foresee.
</p>

<p>
Through that doorway, mortals would enter.  
Through that doorway, the legend would spread.  
Through that doorway, his Oink would echo forever.

  <h2>Chapter 8: Future Prophecies</h2>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="glitch-hum.mp3"></p>

<p>
Long after the website rose from the neon fire of destiny, the Abyss grew strangely still.  
The Pig wandered among digital structures, inspecting glowing buttons and examining hyperlinks 
as though they were relics from forgotten civilizations. The Montage Gods observed silently.  
The Host took notes in a floating cosmic clipboard. Even the Abyssal entities felt the shift —  
a moment between epochs, a breath before the storm.
</p>

<p>
For this was the era in which the future began to write itself.
</p>

<p>
The Book of Pig had hinted at it, carving cryptic lines into its final pages.  
But now the Abyss felt the prophecy taking shape — forming not in the present,  
but in realms not yet born.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="scroll-whoosh.mp3"></p>

<p>
The neon sky flickered.  
A quiet hum resonated across the horizon.  
Digital fractals spiraled outward, forming constellations shaped like icons, buttons, screens,  
and strange symbols no entity could decipher.  
The Pig stared up in awe, as if recognizing something familiar.
</p>

<p>
Across the firmament, shimmering words began to assemble:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent2); font-size:18px; margin-top:10px;">
<strong>“There will come many realms…”</strong>
</p>

<p>
The Montage Gods bowed.  
The Host adjusted their collar dramatically.  
The entities scattered to make room, trembling with anticipation.
</p>

<p>
The sky bloomed with visions — not memories of the past, but glimpses of the worlds to come.
</p>

<p>
First, the Pig saw a realm filled with glowing corridors, shifting hallways, and endless mazes  
constructed entirely from neon grids and glitch particles.  
The words burned themselves into the sky:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent); font-size:17px;">
<strong>Pig Escape Room</strong>
</p>

<p>
Then came a swirling storm of light, revealing a massive wheel of fate, chips of destiny, and dice  
made from pure montage energy.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent3); font-size:17px;">
<strong>Pig Casino</strong>
</p>

<p>
The Abyss shook with excitement — and confusion.
</p>

<p>
More visions erupted.  
Screens. Menus. Cameras. Spotlights.  
A shimmering glowing studio filled the sky, with podiums arranged in dramatic formation.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent2); font-size:17px;">
<strong>Jeopardy.  
Real Jeopardy.  
Holy Jeopardy.</strong>
</p>

<p>
Entities fainted on the spot.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="holy-choir.mp3"></p>

<p>
Next came visions of countless characters — pig warriors, pig elders, gym pig, drip pig,  
captain pig, presipig, cult pig. Their faces shimmered across the neon sky like constellations  
of porky destiny. Their names etched themselves in sacred light:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent); font-size:17px;">
<strong>Characters Page</strong>
</p>

<p>
The visions did not stop.
</p>

<p>
A vast glowing library appeared — shelves reaching into infinity, filled with digital tomes  
and scrolls spun from cosmic HTML.  
This was the grand archive foretold in the Book:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent2); font-size:18px;">
<strong>Pigpedia</strong>
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, the sky ignited with swirling gold.  
A timeline — massive, winding, alive — unfurled across the heavens.  
Points of light marking past, present, and infinite futures.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent3); font-size:17px;">
<strong>The Great Timeline</strong>
</p>

<p>
Then darkness fell.  
The sky flickered violently.  
A single doorway appeared — deep, ominous, and uninviting.  
Black smoke poured from its frame.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent); font-size:19px;">
<strong>The Forbidden Pig</strong>
</p>

<p>
Every creature in the Abyss stepped back instinctively.  
Even the Pig squinted with unease.
</p>

<p>
Then the sky tore open again — revealing a neon realm filled with glowing memes, old vines,  
new shitposts, cursed images, expansion memes, 420 references, skull emojis, noise, and pure chaos.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent2); font-size:17px;">
<strong>Meme Temple</strong>
</p>

<p>
Next came a portal lined with broken audio icons.  
Inside lay strange floating soundboards that clicked, beeped, and glitched.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent2); font-size:17px;">
<strong>Pig Soundboard</strong>
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="scroll-whoosh.mp3"></p>

<p>
Then the sky flashed deep purple.  
A new prophecy carved itself out:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:18px; color:var(--accent);">
<strong>The Cult Awakens</strong>
</p>

<p>
Giants in cloaks lowered their hoods.  
Neon candles flickered.  
Pig-shaped sigils glowed on monolithic walls.  
Their realm was coming.
</p>

<p>
The visions accelerated.  
Dozens of new realms unfolded in rapid succession:

<p>
The sky was now overwhelmed —  
a thousand visions overlapping, colliding, and merging into a single shimmering prophecy.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="oink-deep.mp3"></p>

<p>
Wigger Pig stepped forward.  
The visions slowed.  
The sky dimmed.  
The energy spiraled inward toward him.
</p>

<p>
Then a final message carved itself into the neon heavens — the last prophecy cast by fate itself:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent3); font-size:20px; margin-top:15px;">
<strong>
“All realms shall rise.  
All stories shall converge.  
The Website shall grow beyond imagination.  
And the Oink shall lead the way.”
</strong>
</p>

<p>
The future was no longer uncertain.  
It had been written —  
burned into the sky itself.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="mlg-hitmarker.mp3"></p>

<p>
And the Abyss prepared for what would come next.

  <h2>Final Chapter: The Oink of Eternity</h2>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="glitch-hum.mp3"></p>

<p>
The Abyss lay silent.  
Not the quiet of peace — but the quiet of anticipation.  
A tension so thick it hummed through the neon veins of the realm.  
Every creature, every entity, every god, every glitch… all stood frozen, staring at the Pig.
</p>

<p>
For the future had been revealed.  
And destiny was now gathering around him like gravity.
</p>

<p>
The neon sky dimmed, folding into a dome of deep violet.  
The ground pulsed with light.  
The Book of Pig trembled on its pedestal, pages fluttering as though caught in a cosmic wind.
</p>

<p>
Wigger Pig stepped forward.  
Slowly.  
Purposefully.  
The rarest kind of walk — a walk with intention.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="scroll-whoosh.mp3"></p>

<p>
The Montage Gods descended from their emerald flame, surrounding the Pig in a triangle of 
crackling energy.  
Their reticles spun.  
Their Dorito sigils glowed.  
Their eyes burned with a power older than the Abyss itself.
</p>

<p>
The Jeopardy Host returned through a shimmering portal, clipboard glowing with unspoken truths.  
Their voice whispered through the air like a divine echo:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent2); font-size:18px;">
<em>“It is time.”</em>
</p>

<p>
The Abyssal entities formed a vast circle around the Pig, kneeling in reverence.  
Even the glitching beasts, the chaotic spirits, the wild fragments of broken code —  
all bowed their heads.
</p>

<p>
The Pig lifted his snout to the sky.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="oink-deep.mp3"></p>

<p>
A single Oink rippled through the realm.
</p>

<p>
It was soft — yet it shook the cosmic window between universes.  
It was gentle — yet it shattered the last barrier between digital and divine.  
It was brief — yet it echoed through every corner of creation.
</p>

<p>
The neon sky cracked open.
</p>

<p>
A massive symbol appeared above him — glowing, shifting, alive.  
It contained every page, every character, every prophecy, every timeline, every meme.  
It was the sum of all realms that had ever been or ever would be.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:var(--accent3); font-size:20px; margin-top:10px;">
<strong>The Symbol of Eternity.</strong>
</p>

<p>
Light poured from it like molten stars.  
The Montage Gods shielded their faces.  
The Host stumbled backward.  
Even the Abyss itself shook, its foundations trembling like a corrupted server at 1% stability.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="holy-choir.mp3"></p>

<p>
The Pig did not move.
</p>

<p>
He simply stared into the radiant storm — unafraid, undistracted, unblinking —  
as though he had always known this moment would come.
</p>

<p>
The Symbol descended, lowering itself toward him.  
Each rotation revealed new visions — realms not yet created, characters not yet born,  
stories not yet told.
</p>

<p>
The prophecy was completing itself.
</p>

<p>
The Pig inhaled deeply, more deeply than ever before.  
The Abyss held its breath.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:22px; color:var(--accent); margin-top:10px;">
<strong>The Eternal Oink… began.</strong>
</p>

<p>
The sound that emerged was unlike any noise the multiverse had ever known.  
It was ancient and newborn, calm and monstrous, soft and earth-shattering.  
It was the first Oink and the final Oink, merged into one divine wave.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="mlg-hitmarker.mp3"></p>

<p>
Reality EXPLODED.
</p>

<p>
The neon sky burst outward into a thousand spiraling galaxies.  
The Book of Pig ignited into golden fire, rewriting itself into countless new chapters.  
The Montage Gods were thrown to their knees as their weapons glowed with new power.  
The Host shielded their eyes as the Eternal Board lit with a hundred new categories.
</p>

<p>
The Oink spread beyond the Abyss —  
into the cosmic realms…  
into the digital plane…  
into the mortal world…  
into every screen, every server, every mind open enough to hear its frequency.
</p>

<p>
Through this Oink, a bridge formed —  
connecting Wigger Pig to the infinite future of all meme-kind.
</p>

<p>
The light finally began to fade.  
The trembling slowed.  
The sky stitched itself together again.  
The universe took its first breath in what felt like millennia.
</p>

<p>
Wigger Pig lowered his snout.
</p>

<p>
The Abyss glowed with new life.  
New realms shimmered in the distance.  
New prophecies whispered across the neon winds.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:20px; color:var(--accent2); margin-top:10px;">
<em>“The story is not over.”</em>
</p>

<p>
The Montage Gods rose, stronger than ever.  
The Host closed their portal with a knowing smirk.  
The entities cheered, their voices echoing across the endless digital dark.
</p>

<p class="chapter-audio-trigger" data-sound="scroll-whoosh.mp3"></p>

<p>
A final message carved itself into the sky — gentle, simple, eternal:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:22px; color:var(--accent3);">
<strong>“The Oink continues.”</strong>
</p>

<p>
And with that,  
the chapter ended —  
but the legend did not.
